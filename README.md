# Wise Street theme
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewiseman/assets/master/lav-theme-banner.png "Lav")


This theme is a combination of [SynthWave '84](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode "SynthWave '84") and [Tokyo Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night "Tokyo Night")


I love SynthWave '84 text colors and as of Tokyo Night it's background colors.
And from those two these theme came about.
